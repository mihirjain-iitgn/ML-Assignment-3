### Logistic Regression Time Complexity:

Say Input has shape (n,m) and ouput has k classes.
A matrix of shape (m,k) is learned in Logistic Regression.

#### Training :

For each epoch
- The prediction is calculated  
    > Matrix multiplcation of X and parameters. O(n*m*k)
- Softmax : O(n*k)
- Gradient Computation  
    > Matrix Multiplication of X.T and (y_hat - y_true). O(n*m*k)(Here y_true is one-hot)
- Parameters Update : O(m*k)

Overall : O(n*m*k) per epoch

#### Testing :

Only prediction step : O(n*m*k)
